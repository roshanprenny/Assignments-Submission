            A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, 
            and are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing 
            you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs. ... O
            ne of the most important of these is a topic sentence.

            f we look around, we'll find that the idea of paragraphs with a
             minimum of 3-5 sentences and a maximum of 8 is pretty common. 
             But there are some who say that two to three paragraphs 
            per page are best and others who say that 5 to 7 lines will do the job.
